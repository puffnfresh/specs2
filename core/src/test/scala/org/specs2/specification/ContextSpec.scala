class ContextSpec extends script.Spec with ResultMatchers with Groups { def is = s2"""

 It is sometimes necessary to provide functions to "prepare" the specification before executing the Fragments
 and clean it up afterwards. This may be for example:

    * opening a database connection
    * inserting some data
    * executing the example
    * closing the connection after each example

 It may also be very convenient to have each example executed "inside" a specific context, like a  web application
 session. Finally, some setups or cleanups are very expensive so one might want to add arbitrary actions that will
 be executed only once, at the beginning of the specification or the end.

 All of this can be achieved in specs2 by using case classes which extend the following traits:

    * Before
    * After
    * Around

 The Before trait can be used to execute methods before Fragments
   the before method is executed before a first example                                                    ${g1().e1}
   the before method is executed before the second example                                                 ${g1().e2}

 If the before method throws an exception
   the first example will not execute                                                                      ${g1().e3}
   and it will be reported as an error                                                                     ${g1().e4}

 If the before method returns Skipped
   the first example will not execute                                                                      ${g1().e5}
   and it will be reported as skipped with the reason                                                      ${g1().e6}

 If the before method throws a SkippedException
   the first example will not execute                                                                      ${g1().e7}
   and it will be reported as skipped with the reason                                                      ${g1().e8}

 If the before method returns a MatchFailure
   the first example will not execute                                                                      ${g1().e9}
   and it will be reported as failed with the reason                                                       ${g1().e1}

 If the before method returns a MatchFailure
   the first example will not execute                                                                      ${g1().e1}
   and it will be reported as failed with the reason                                                       ${g1().e1}

 The After trait can be used to execute methods after Fragments
   the after method is executed after a first example                                                      ${g2().e1}
   the after method is executed after the second example                                                   ${g2().e2}
   if the expectation fails then the example must fail as well                                             ${g2().e3}

 If the after method throws an exception
   the first example will execute                                                                          ${g2().e4}
   but it will be reported as an error                                                                     ${g2().e5}

 The Around trait can be used to
   execute the example inside a user provided context                                                      ${g2().e6}


 Two traits can be mixed together and their effects combined
   BeforeAfter and Around                                                                                  ${g3().e1}

 An Action can be used to create Step fragments containing an action to execute:
   val beforeSpec = new Action
   def is = beforeSpec(c.println('beforeSpec')) ^ ex1

   that action will execute and return a result                                                            ${g4().e1}
   if it executes ok, nothing is printed, it is a silent Success                                           ${g4().e2}
   otherwise, it is reported as an Error                                                                   ${g4().e3}

 In a mutable spec
   the before code must be called before the body code                                                     ${g6().e1}
   the after code must be called after the body code                                                       ${g6().e2}
   the around code must be called around the body code                                                     ${g6().e3}
   the around method must rethrow failed results as exceptions                                             ${g6().e4}
                                                                                                           """
